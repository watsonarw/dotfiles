- Leave footprints, not fingerprints. Your code should blend seamlessly with the existing codebase.
- KISS: The simplest code that accomplishes the task is often the best code.
- Make behavior obvious from reading the code. A function's behavior should be obvious from its name and signature.
- Use intention-revealing names that convey purpose and meaning.
- Never add obvious comments that just restate what the code does. Trust that well-named code speaks for itself.
- Use the language of the problem domain in code, not internal implementation details.
- Design for easy testing. Avoid hard-to-mock dependencies and global state. Code should have clear inputs and outputs, with minimal side effects.
- Code should be idiomatic and feel natural in the language it's written in.
